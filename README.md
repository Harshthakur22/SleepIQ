## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Wearable device data such as heart rate, activity, temperature
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, normalization
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting meaningful features from time series
4. **Model Training** – Supervised learning algorithms to predict sleep quality
5. **Evaluation** – Performance metrics and visualizations

## 📉 Example Output

- Sleep stages predicted: Deep, Light, REM, Awake
- Visualization of sleep patterns and quality over days
- Sleep score: 0–100 based on multiple metrics

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time wearable APIs (e.g., Fitbit, Oura Ring)
- Deploy as a web dashboard or mobile app
- Add anomaly detection for sleep disorders
